As a part of the class assignment 3, a few tutorial links were shared by the instructor. Amonng these tutorials, I would mention about "Learning Git and GitHub (2021)" by Ray Villalobos. This is a tutorial offered by LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-git-and-github-14213624/travel-the-multiverse-with-git-and-github?u=57683345). Being one of the most popular version control system Git and GitHub let manage changes we make over files over time. This is very essential requirement for the developers. I have learned the fundamental commands required to work with Git projects. Ray explained how to use checkpoints (commits), create branches, explore existing projects, clone them to local hard drive, and use them as templates for new projects.
